                       Leopoldo Lugones (narrator, poet, journalist, historian, librarian, pedagogue, teacher, translator, biographer, philologist, theosophist, diplomat, politician and nationalist sympathizer) was born in our town, on June 13rd of 1874 (remembered today as the National Writers Day), and he died in Buenos Aires, in 1938. 
Lugones was a man of vast culture, and the biggest exponent of argentinian modernism, and one of the most influential and important writers of Spanish speakers literature. For him, language was one of the most important nationalist issues. 
He spent his childhood and adolescence in Villa de María, and after a little time in Santiago del Estero, neighboring province, he established himself in Buenos Aires, in 1895. 
After working in not so big jobs, he started to work in the National Teachers Library, which took him to live in Europe, and then he decided to reside in Paris between 1911 and 1914, but he decided to come back right after the blast of the First World War. 
He won the National Literature Award in 1926, and right two years after that he founded the Argentinian Writers Society. 
Jorge Luis Borges was one of the first persons to position Leopoldo Lugones as one of the most essential writers of argentinian literature. 
Unfortunately, he killed himself drinking whiskey with cyanide after a depression caused by a deep emotional crisis that was provoked supposedly by Lugones support to the 1930 coup d’ètat and the deception this dictatorship brought. Even when there are not so many certain facts, because there are so many speculations about why he killed himself: there are rumors about love deception, social shame or antidemocratic repudiation. When he died, he left over the table of his house a whiskey bottle that was in the middle, and a letter that said: “I can not finish the book about Roca. Stop”. 
Lugones is an icon of our culture, not talking only about the town and Córdoba, because we need to talk about Argentina too: he is one of the most important people we will ever have. Thanks to his literary innovation, the genre's diversity that he knew how to convey, his intellectual influence that he left for the next generations, his political and social help to form new generations has given so much to our national culture, that trying to not make him a key national piece of our history is even impossible. 
Lugones knew how to work with literature, and turn it into a legacy that is impossible to delete.
