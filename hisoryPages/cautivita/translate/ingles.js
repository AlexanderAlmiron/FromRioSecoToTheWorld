        <p>Villa de María (actual name), it is marked by historic events like the attack of an indigenous malón (unexpected attack of aboriginals) in 1748, where they took the decision of taking an icon of the place and people: that was called Virgen del Rosario, which was recovered in a memorable fight, and, subsequently, it is known as “Virgen Cautivita” (Cautiva in english means captive). 
The year was 1748 when an indigenous malón got to the place razing everything they found in their way and decided that they must take as a trophy the image of the Virgen del Rosario, that was being venerated in her chapel. Everything that these indigenous found in the countryside or the people’s houses was killed or captured without anyone putting up resistance. The land was devastated everywhere. Their bad strength came up to the temple where this virgin was venerated, and then they destroyed the door provided with iron sheets and bars with an ax. 
The captain Francisco de la Barreda, his guide Landriel and their men got the notice about the horrible fact, and, about that, they decided to start a persecution against indigenous, whom were divided in two groups, which could make that the tropes that were following them feel lost for a few moments. But at the end, they could find the indigenous people and get the saint image of the Virgin back, which right after the first moment was returned to her chapel. 
Our Virgen del Rosario is known since then as “La Cautivita”. 
Every year, when the Patron Saint Festivities are celebrated, a certain part of the population recreate this historical conflict, which is called the “The Rescue of the Virgin”, and it means an entertainment for little kids and grown people.
