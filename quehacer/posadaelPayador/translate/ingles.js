                       The payador’s inn was Gustavo Guichon’s resting place: where he went to settle and plan for his next trip, or re-establish bonds with his family, since his trips used to be really long. The payador’s inn is a House Museum because it has two aspects: a family member living there, and the place being officially declared a museum.
Gustavo Guichón realized he could be a payador when he was eight years old. His teacher gave him a poem to recite for mother’s day, and when he left it at school, he decided to start improvising verses that rhymed.
