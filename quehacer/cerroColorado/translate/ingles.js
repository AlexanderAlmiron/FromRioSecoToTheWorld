        <p>Located in the north of Cordoba, the Cerro Colorado is a historically, archaeologically, and naturally relevant spot. It is located in the intersection of Río Seco, Sobremonte, and Tulumba, and it is part of the last foothills of Cordoba’s north's hills.
This place is recognized mail¡nly for its over 3000 instances of cave art, made by native towns called Comechingones and Sanavirones between the fifth and sixteenth centuries. These representations include scenes of daily life, rituals, and wars, reflecting the worldview of natives to that area as well as their contact with Spanish conquistadors. Thanks to this rich culture, Cerro Colorado was declared a National Historical Monument in 1961, and afterwards, a Cultural and Natural Reserve.
It is about 3000 hectares, with a remarkable biodiversity, including fauna like rheas, grey foxes, pumas, and several bird species; and typical flora to the region, like carob trees, talas, chañares, and espinillos. It has a great environmental and landscape value.
In the nearby town is the House Museum Atahualpa Yupanqui, where the famous folkloric musician lived. It is now turned into a museum and a center of cultural interest.
The access to Cerro Colorado is from National Road 9 to Santa Elena, taking a detour on Province Road 21. It is most ideal to visit with tour guides, to preserve the cave paintings, as well as getting to places more easily.
Cerro Colorado is a clear example of a mix between natural and cultural patrimony, being a key point for understanding prehispanic history and the identity of the north of Cordoba.
