        <p>The historic facts in Rio Seco are too many, and that’s how we talk about the year 1821, when the supreme entrerriano that was known as Pancho Ramirez (even though when his real name was Francisco) was being persecuted by Juan Bautista Bustos, that was the governor of Cordoba at the moment, and who ordered to Bedoya, his substitute governor, keep the trace. 
His persecution started at Cordoba, that was in charge of Bustos, and when Pancho got to San Francisco del Chañar –a town that is not so long–, he was intercepted by a patrol, that was out precisely to intercept him and was coming since the fort in Rio Seco, that was also commanded by the Colonel Francisco de Bedoya. 
After the combat the Julio 10th morning, Ramirez gives up having a last wish: he wanted to come back to rescue his wife Delfina. 
He is murdered and decapitated in the same place, and his head was moved to the town and exposed in it. That same place now has a monolith, remembering him, and it is a few meters from the Cerro del Romero.
