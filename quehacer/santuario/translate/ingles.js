          Since before the foundation, there existed an old chapel in Cerro del Romero, but its transformation to a Water Fountain and Prison are close to 1760 and 1768 respectively. Then, it turned into a place for the general command of the northern border of the province of Cordoba. 
The location was founded in 1796 because of the Cordoba governor, who gave the order, and who took as base the population that was living around the chapel and the old post where so many processors passed through, in their campaigns to the north of the country and toward the High Peru.
